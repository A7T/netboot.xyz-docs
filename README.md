This is the main documentation repository for [netboot.xyz](https://netboot.xyz) which is built upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.  

The contents of this repo are deployed automatically to netboot.xyz upon being merged.

## Development and Contributions

Contributions to the documentation are always welcome.  Please feel free to open pull requests to this repo if you see a bug, want to improve the existing documentation, or want to add some how-tos to help others.  

Ultimately this site is for helping others boot operating systems and using network booting related tools, so any documenation or articles that might be able to help others are welcome.

## Running Locally

The documentation site can be run locally for development.  In order to do this, install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and from the repository directory, run:

```
hugo server
```

You can then load up the site in a web browser with the URL shown in the output and view changes in realtime.
